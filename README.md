#  Part 1 
        The coefficients are 11.43247 and 0.07949 for mpg. The linear model is considered to be zero. This linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. #
# Part 2 
        The current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually. 
# Part 3 
        The value of t-test is -1.8931, and the p-value is 0.06028. The p-value showes is bigger than 0.005, so the relationship should be significant. 
# Part 4
        My metric is cost. The null hypothesis is there is a relationship between cost and MechaCar performs. I would use T-test to test the hypothesis.
